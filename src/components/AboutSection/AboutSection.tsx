      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a fresh graduate in Information Technology based in Metro Manila,
        Philippines. I specialize in Web Development and enjoy the challenge in
        taking on project requirements and complex designs and implementing them
        into simple and beautiful systems for clients and customers while doing
        it in the most elegant and efficient way I am capable of for other
        developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am most confident in my ability to work with JavaScript and its
        ecosystem, but I am also capable of quickly learning new languages,
        frameworks, and libraries if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not programming, I'll usually be gaming, or occassionally be
        working out in the gym.
